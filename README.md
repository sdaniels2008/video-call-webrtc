# Dating App with React Native, Expo and WebRTC

As someone new to React Native and Expo, I wanted to challenge myself by creating an experimental dating app. In this project, I was able to create about various features such as chatting with online users, audio and video calling using WebRTC and profile management.

I used React Navigation to easily move between screens and incorporated React Query to enhance the user experience. This project was an excellent learning opportunity and gave me a deeper understanding of React Native and Expo.

## WebRTC

WebRTC stands for Web Real-Time Communication, and it is an open-source technology that enables real-time communication between users without the need for any additional plugins or software.

## Socket.IO

I used socket.io to implement a simple signaling server for this project and to enable users to live chat with each other.
